# Changelog

All notable changes to Vintage-E. Each GitHub release uses its section from this file as its release notes.

## 1.9.0 — 2026-10-17

### Added
- **Set a value from anywhere (admins).** Hover a block or item and press **Ctrl + K**: a small box shows its value and lets you set one (saved like `/emc set`) or **Unpin** it again. It works on inventory and container slots, the handbook (item pictures on a page, or the page's own item), any other window, the block you're looking at, and the held item. Change the key in the game's controls.
- **Hand-written recipes.** `/emc recipe` opens a window to tell the mapper about things it can't see being made, like other mods' boats: put the result in the first slot and its ingredients in the others by clicking them with an item held on the mouse (pick a slot to change its amount), or edit the recipe line by hand, wildcards included (`game:plank-*`). The server checks each recipe against the mapper, saves it to the new `CustomRecipes` setting and works out the values again; recipes it can't use are refused with the reason. Saved recipes can be edited or removed there, or with `/emc recipe add|remove|list` from chat. Value files can carry them too (`recipes`).
- **Constructions are found by themselves.** Things built in stages (like sailboats on rollers) from other mods, such as Shipwright's, are matched to the item they make by name, so they get a value without a `constructions` rule.
- **Gray list.** For blocks/items nothing makes yet, but that a mod might later (uncraftable blocks, say): gray-listed ones are left out of `/emc missing` and never given a guessed value, but get one as soon as a recipe makes them. `/emc graylist` opens its window (select, take off, or untick **Hide missing** to add missing ones), `/emc graylist add|remove` does the held item, and the missing window has a **Gray-list it** button. Saved as `GrayList`; value files can have `grayList`.
- **Blacklist only a mod's missing items.** With a mod picked in the `/emc missing` filter, **Blacklist its missing** blacklists just that mod's missing blocks/items by their own codes, instead of the whole mod with a wildcard, so the values its other items already have stay.
- **Watch of Flowing Time indicator.** While the watch is on, an icon on screen shows how fast time runs (`Time x10`), and the watch glows. Type `.vintagee` in chat for this computer's settings: turn either off, and set the icon's size and position and the glow's colour.
- **Nutrition from the Body and Life Stones.** A new tool mode feeds you through the game's hunger, so your food groups fill up too (the emptiest first), for 1 EMC per saturation instead of 0.5. A stone on a pedestal follows its mode.
- **Bigger Alchemical Bags.** Upgrade an Alchemical Bag with 4 dark matter for a 48-slot Dark Matter Alchemical Bag, and that with 4 red matter for a 64-slot Red Matter Alchemical Bag. Upgrading keeps what's in the bag.
- Pedestals show the item on them floating and turning above them.
- Energy Condensers show how much EMC a second their collectors and relays are giving them.

### Changed
- **Shorter tooltips.** Vintage-E's items keep a one-line description in their tooltip; the full details are on their handbook page, under **How it works**.
- **Rings go in the hand slot**, with gloves and other mods' rings, instead of the arm slot. Rings already worn on the arm keep working there.
- **Nova Catalyst and Cataclysm are lit like the game's bombs**: hold right-click on them with a torch or a firestarter. Sneak + right-click with an empty hand no longer lights them.
- The **illuminal divergence manifold** (translocator part) is a free ingredient, so the rickety translocator gets a value.
- Tooltips of lenses, amulets and the Ignition Ring name the key the fire-projectile control is bound to now, instead of always saying R.
- The Destruction Catalyst's and Catalytic Lens's charge labels show what the tunnel costs at most, so the Catalytic Lens's charges 3–7 no longer look the same. (Its shot stops growing at charge 3, the Hyperkinetic Lens's biggest; the tunnel keeps getting deeper.)
- In the `/emc missing`, `/emc blacklist`, `/emc notransmute`, `/emc graylist` and `/emc contents` windows, picks are kept when you change the filters; the selection line now says how many of them the filters are hiding, and the button that drops them all is labelled **Clear selection** (it was **Clear**).
- The `/emc configure` editor scrolls to keep the line you're typing on in view.

### Fixed
- **Full gem armour (and Swiftwolf's Rending Gale) stops fall damage again**: Vintage-E's protection now gets its turn before the game takes the damage off. The same goes for fire protection.
- **Evertide and Volcanite Amulets on a pedestal change the weather.** The game's weather command needs a player to run it, so it did nothing; the pedestal now sets the rain directly. With several pedestals, rain wins; taking the amulet off (or the pedestal unloading) gives the weather back to the game.
- **Energy Condensers fed by collectors and relays** show and keep the EMC they're given; before, their window and info only caught up when they made something.
- Archangel's Smite arrows look like arrows and point where they fly; lens, fire, water and lava shots show their whole picture instead of one corner of it.
- The cooked item on a Dark/Red Matter Furnace no longer jumps up for a moment when cooking finishes.
- The tablet's magnet filter text no longer runs into the filter slots.

## 1.8.0 — 2026-10-17

### Added
- **Magnet for the Transmutation Tablet.** The tablet window has a magnet slot: put a Black Hole Band or Void Ring in it and, while you carry the tablet, items on the ground within 7 blocks that pass its filter are pulled in and transmuted into your EMC (and learned), like burning them at the table. The filter is a row of 9 slots: **Pull: only these** (an empty filter pulls nothing) or **Pull: all except these**. Click a filter slot while holding an item to add it; click with an empty hand to clear it. Things you just threw away are left alone for a few seconds. Everything is stored on the tablet.
- **Sorting** in the transmutation window: most EMC first, least EMC first, name A to Z, name Z to A.
- **Forgetting asks first.** Ctrl + right-click on a known item opens a confirmation before it's forgotten.
- **Value loops.** The mapper finds rings of unvalued items that are each only made from the next (A needs B, B needs C, C needs A), which is why none of them can get a value. The login message says how many there are, **`/emc loop`** lists each one from its first item (`a -> b -> c -> a`) and writes them to `emc-loops.txt`, and the missing window says when an item is stuck in one. Recipe loops that kept making each other cheaper (and were settled by keeping their first value) are listed too.
- **`/emc dump hand` explains missing values**: every way the mod knows of making the item, which ingredients have no value and why (two levels deep), whether it's blacklisted or a free ingredient, and the value loop it's in. If the values came from the cache, it works them out again first so it can explain them.
- **`/emc notransmute`**: a list of blocks/items that keep their EMC value (recipes still use it) but can't be burned for EMC, learned or created, at the table, in condensers, by the Gem of Eternal Density, the Mercurial Eye or the tablet's magnet. The window works like `/emc blacklist`: tick **Show valued items** to pick some and press **Stop transmuting**; select listed ones and press **Allow transmuting**. `/emc notransmute add|remove` does the held item. Saved as the `NoTransmute` setting; such items say so in their tooltip.
- **Free ingredients**: blacklisted (no value, can't be burned or created) but free in recipes that use them. The customized translocator schematic is one by default. Add more with the `FreeIngredients` setting or a value file's `freeIngredients`.
- **Red Matter Pedestal**: twice the reach and twice the effect of the Dark Matter Pedestal (crafted from one, with red matter and red matter blocks).
- **Reset settings to their defaults**: in the `/emc configure` window, every changed setting has a **reset** link on its row and the selected one has **Reset to default**; **Reset all** puts every setting back (both ask first). From chat: `/emc configure <setting> default` and `/emc configure resetall`.
- **Shift-click** in the `/emc missing`, `/emc blacklist`, `/emc notransmute` and `/emc contents` windows selects everything between the last name you clicked and this one.

### Changed
- The bone arrow is worth the same as the flint arrow, whatever that works out to.
- The rickety translocator and the illuminal divergence manifold are off the built-in blacklist.
- The **Tome of Knowledge** is creative-only: it has no recipe and no EMC value, only works in creative mode, and only teaches what's in the creative inventory and can be transmuted.
- **The transmutation window is much faster** with many known items: each known item is looked up once and kept, so opening the window and typing in the search box only filter and sort. The server also checks knowledge with a lookup set instead of searching the whole list.
- `/emc dump`, `/emc dump hand` and `/emc loop` say in chat where their file is. All files (CSV lists, dumps, loops, the self-test and the cache) now go to `VintagestoryData/ModData/vintagee/` as documented; before, they went to `VintagestoryData/vintagee/`, which you can delete.

### Fixed
- The `/emc missing` and `/emc blacklist` windows no longer crowd or overlap: the summary is shorter and every text is measured, so the filters, buttons and hints each get their own row whatever the text length or GUI scale. The same for the `/emc contents` and `/emc configure` windows.
- `/emc configure` no longer jumps back to the top of the list when you click a setting or save.
- Items cooked on a spit no longer float above the Dark/Red Matter Furnaces: they lie on the furnace (it has no spit).

## 1.7.0 — 2026-10-16

### Added — more ways to work out EMC values
- **Placement states are worth exactly what they turn back into.** A block that only exists placed (facing another way, snow-covered, a fence piece joined to its neighbours, an open gate) gets the value of the item you get when you pick or break it, instead of a guess.
- **Smarter variant guesses.** Values are now copied using the variant groups each block/item type defines. They are copied freely across groups that only change the look or placement (rock, colour, wood, facing, snow cover...). They are never copied across groups that change what something is: ore, metal, mold type, and families like ores, crystals, clutter, boats and gadgets. Before, cinnabar was priced like gold-bearing quartz, platinum ingots like gold, and a black axe mold like an anvil mold. Things that can't be valued honestly now show in `/emc missing` instead. Groups in neither list (clothes types, for example) still get a guess, now the middle value of the variants rather than the highest.
- **Other mods' variants of base-game families** (their own wood types for the game's logs, say) borrow the base game's value when nothing else values them.
- **Fuel and food estimates** for anything nothing else can value. Fuels are valued by how hot and how long they burn, at the rate charcoal and coal are valued. Food is valued by how filling it is, at the rate of valued food of the same kind. Turn it off with `EstimateFuelAndFood`.
- **Values are worked out in stages.** The recipe graph is solved again after each step (ratios and trader prices, look/placement variants, family defaults, other variants, fuel/food), so anything made from newly valued things gets its real recipe value before a rougher step guesses at it. This fixed the Destruction Catalyst and the Hyperkinetic and Catalytic Lenses, which were guessed from the Tome of Knowledge (1,458,679 EMC) instead of costed from their recipes.
- **Beehive kiln firing** is read. Brown, gray, cream, orange and tan shingles, bricks and pottery come out of the kiln. Before, they were priced from trader sales or copied from another colour (a brown clay roof was 6x a black one, tiles 4x what their clay costs). Now they all cost the clay they're made of.
- **Things built in stages**: sailboats are built on rollers from logs, firewood, about 300 planks, support beams, rope and linen. They're now worth what those stages take (an oak sailboat is about 12,700 EMC). Other mods' stage-built things can be added with a `constructions` line in the value file.
- **Carburizing** (iron to blister steel in the stone coffin) is read, for mods that add carburizable items.
- **Crucibles of molten metal** count their metal (100 units = one ingot) in item + contents mode.
- **Cheese slices** are worth their share of the wheel. Before, 2- and 3-slice cheeses were worth a whole wheel.
- **Mineral defaults** for fluorite, kernite, phosphorite, corundum and graphite, and thatch's value for aged thatch roofs. Before, those ores were copied from anthracite and the roofs had none.
- Ratio rules are applied again after trader prices, and fuel/food estimates only apply to real inventory items (not a growing crop or a pit kiln).
- **Why something has no value**: `/emc missing` shows a reason under each entry (nothing makes it, or which ingredient has no value), and `emc-missing.csv` has a `why` column. In the base game only 19 items are left, and none of them can be crafted. They are the Erel and bone arrows, the Erel spear, four boss-themed figureheads, platinum, uranium and stainless steel items, cupronickel nails, crushed peridotite and the translocator schematic.
- `/emc dump` says which step valued each item, and why a guess was made (`differs in: rock`).
- **Show blacklisted / Hide missing.** The `/emc missing` window has a **Show blacklisted** switch that mixes everything on the blacklist into the list, tagged in red, with a **Remove from blacklist** button for them. The `/emc blacklist` window has the mirror: untick **Hide missing** to mix in everything that has no value, tagged in amber with the reason, and blacklist them from there. Both switches are remembered until you quit.

### Added — items that hold things or keep their material
- **Three modes** for every block/item that holds things (buckets, jugs, pots, bowls, crocks, barrels, bags) or keeps what it's made of on the item (round shields, lanterns, chests, clutter, chiseled blocks):
  - **Item only:** burns and is created as the plain item. A container that still holds something won't burn.
  - **Item + contents:** worth the item plus what it holds or is made of, and you learn and create exactly that version.
  - **Item price only:** exactly that version, but it costs and burns for the item alone; its contents are free.
- **Built-in defaults** only where they make sense. Containers are item only. Items whose material or type lives on the item, and chiseled blocks, are item + contents, because a plain copy of those would be the wrong or default version.
- **Each material is its own value.** A round shield ranges from 289 (tin bronze) to 4,104 (gold). Chiseled blocks are worth their voxels of each material. Containers in item + contents mode add what they hold (meals and pies times their servings).
- **Copies come out new:** no wear, freshness or clothing condition is copied. Condensers follow the same modes for their target.
- **`/emc contents`** opens a window listing every such block/item with its kind and mode, where it came from (default or set by you), search and filters by mod, kind and mode. Select several and switch them all to item only, item + contents, item price only, or back to the default. `/emc contents <item|full|itemprice|default>` sets the held item. Saved to `StackDataModes`; applies at once, no remap.
- The transmutation grid shows each exact version as its own entry. **Ctrl + right-click forgets an entry.** Each player can know up to `MaxExactKnowledge` (500) exact versions.
- `/emc dump` also writes `emc-contents.csv`: every such item, its mode and its material values.

### Added — ProjectE's original textures and sounds
- **`ProjectETextures`** (off by default) swaps Vintage-E's textures for ProjectE's wherever ProjectE has one: rings, stones, amulets, gadgets, matter, fuels, covalence dust, alchemical bags, blocks, machines, the transmutation table, nova catalysts, the interdiction torch, projectiles, and the matter look of tools, armour, the pedestal and the furnaces. Rings and stones light up while switched on, and the Ring of Arcana and Swiftwolf's Rending Gale show their mode, like in ProjectE. Condensers and the alchemical chest use faces cut from ProjectE's chest textures. It's applied by the server at start-up, so players see it without setting anything.
- **`ProjectESounds`** (off by default) plays ProjectE's eight sounds for what ProjectE plays them for: switching rings on (heal) and off (uncharge), lens and ring shots (power), the Destruction Catalyst and area mining (destruct), the Philosopher's Stone and lava (transmute), water (water magic), stones and pedestals healing (heal), putting a ring on a pedestal (charge) and taking it off (uncharge), and a looping wind while flying with Swiftwolf's Rending Gale. It applies straight away.
- Both are in `/emc configure`. The files are ProjectE's, under its MIT licence (see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md), copied by `tools/import_projecte_assets.py`.

### Added — settings in game
- **`/emc configure`** opens a settings window: every setting, what it does, and an editor that fits it (a switch, a number box, or one entry per line for lists and tables). Save checks the value, writes `ModConfig/vintagee.json` and applies it straight away; settings that change values remap them.
- From chat: `/emc configure list`, `/emc configure <setting>`, `/emc configure <setting> <value>`, list `add`/`remove`/`clear`, table `set <key> <value>`/`remove <key>`/`clear`, and `/emc configure reload` after editing the file by hand. `/emc config` works too.
- Admins are told about `/emc configure` when they join.

### Changed
- **The Repair Talisman also restores clothing condition**, on clothes you wear or carry and for players near it on a pedestal: 1% a minute by default. `RepairTalismanRepairsClothing`, `RepairTalismanClothingPercentPerMinute`, `RepairTalismanClothingMinCondition` and `RepairTalismanClothingMaxCondition` turn it off, set the speed, leave badly worn clothes for a sewing kit, and set where it stops.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-10-14

### Added
- **Wear your Klein Star and rings**: a Klein Star goes in the **emblem** slot and shows on your chest; the Black Hole Band, Swiftwolf's Rending Gale, Harvest Goddess Band, Ignition Ring, Zero Ring, Ring of Arcana and Void Ring go in the **arm** slot and show as a band with its gem on your wrist. Worn, they keep working: rings keep their effects and a worn star's EMC still pays for rings and gadgets. Switch a ring on or off before you put it on (right-click still toggles it in your hand).
- **Swiftwolf's Rending Gale speed**: the tool-mode key now also picks 1x, 1.5x, 2x or 3x speed, for running and flying. Flying costs 6.4 EMC a second x your speed; running faster than normal costs 6.4 EMC a second x (speed - 1) while you move.
- **Select several entries** in the `/emc missing` and `/emc blacklist` windows: click names to tick them, or **Select shown** for everything the search and filters show, then give them all one value, blacklist them or take them off the blacklist in one go.
- **Blacklist a whole mod** from those windows: pick the mod in the mod filter and press **Blacklist whole mod** (saved as `modid:*`; **Unblacklist whole mod** undoes it). The base game can't be done as a whole.
- **`/emc dump hand`**: the held item's value, how it was worked out, and what each of its ingredients is worth, in chat and in `ModData/vintagee/emc-dump-<item>.txt`.
- `emc-values.csv` has a name column, and `/emc dump` also writes `emc-blacklisted.csv`.
- **Recipes**: 4 emeralds into 1 diamond and 1 diamond into 4 emeralds with the philosopher's stone, like iron and gold.
- **Values**: live fish (the same as the raw fish), Jonas parts 1,024, Jonas sub-assemblies 2,048, the night vision mask 4,096 and its upgrades 1,024, loose paper found in ruins (the same as parchment), metal parts and metal scraps 64 if nothing else values them, and shields from any mod 256 if nothing else values them.

### Changed
- **Matter and gem armour are silent**: no more metal clanking when you walk or run in them.
- **Creatures and NPCs from every mod, and maps from every mod**, are blacklisted (before, only the base game's). They're creative-only. Live butterflies and fish stay valued, since you can catch them.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-10-14

### Changed — closer to ProjectE
- **Matter furnaces now work like the game's firepit**: same window, fuel slot, cooking pots, crucibles and spits, lit with a firestarter or torch. The Dark Matter Furnace burns fuel 1.4x hotter, makes it last 3x as long and cooks 4x faster; the Red Matter Furnace 2x hotter, 4x as long, 12x faster. Collectors and relays next to one can keep it burning on EMC (2 or 4 EMC a second). Furnaces placed in 1.4.0 turn into the new ones by themselves; anything that was in them drops on top.
- **Hyperkinetic and Catalytic Lenses** shoot an explosive charge that flies straight and blows up where it hits, like ProjectE's. Pick the charge with the tool-mode key: radius 4, 6, 8 or 10 for 384, 768, 1,536 or 2,304 EMC. The Hyperkinetic Lens shoots on right-click; both shoot with the new **fire-projectile key (R)**, which you can rebind in the controls.
- The **Catalytic Lens** and **Destruction Catalyst** dig ProjectE's 3x3 tunnels: 1, 4, 8 or 16 deep for the catalyst, 1 and then 16 to 64 for the lens, 8 EMC a block. What they break drops where you clicked.
- **Klein Stars** use ProjectE's own artwork.
- **Swiftwolf's Rending Gale lets you fly** (jump to rise, sneak to sink) and has ProjectE's shield, which pushes hostile creatures and arrows away within 5 blocks. Pick flight + shield, flight or shield with the tool-mode key. Flying and the shield each cost 6.4 EMC a second, the ring switches off when you run out, and falling doesn't hurt while it's on or for 15 seconds after you stop flying. The 40% run speed bonus is gone.
- **Ring of Arcana**: switch each of its four effects on or off on its own with the tool-mode key, instead of only one at a time. It's free, like ProjectE's, and fire can't hurt you while you carry it.
- **Ignition Ring** and **Volcanite Amulet**: fire can't hurt you while you carry them, on or off.
- **Harvest Goddess Band** also harvests ripe crops, still grows crops slowly (for free) when switched off, and right-clicking farmland plants the seeds you carry up to 8 blocks around.
- **Black Hole Band**: right-click a water or lava source to remove it; pulls items within 7 blocks.
- **Repair Talisman** works whenever you carry it.
- **Archangel's Smite** fires homing arrows (3 damage each, costing what an arrow is worth): one on right-click, a volley of 10 on left-click.
- **Evertide and Volcanite Amulets** shoot water and lava with the fire-projectile key. The Ignition Ring (and the Ring of Arcana) shoot a fireball.
- **Pedestal**: an Evertide Amulet on it makes it rain, a Volcanite Amulet clears the sky; the Zero Ring also puts out burning creatures, the Harvest Goddess Band also harvests, the Watch also slows hostile creatures, and the Black Hole Band fills containers on any side. It now takes every ring, stone, amulet, talisman and watch.
- The **Watch of Flowing Time** now actually changes the flow of time. While it's on, time runs 10x faster for the whole world (crops, cooking, curing, drying, day and night), as when everyone sleeps, and crops near you grow faster still. The tool-mode key switches it to slow time: days last 3x longer and hostile creatures near you are slowed. It costs EMC every second it's on and stops when you run out. Before, it only grew nearby crops.
- **Interdiction Torch** is brighter: light level 20 (a torch is 14).
- Every block and item description now says what it does with the real numbers: rates, capacities, costs, ranges, temperatures.
- Emeralds are worth a quarter of a diamond (2,048 EMC).

### Added
- **Void Ring** (Black Hole Band + Gem of Eternal Density + 2 red matter): pulls in items, condenses junk, and sneak + right-click teleports you up to 64 blocks.
- **`/emc add <amount> [player]`** and **`/emc remove <amount> [player]`**: change a player's personal EMC (yours if no name is given). `/emc give` still works.
- **`/emc blacklist`**: the same window as `/emc missing`, listing everything on the blacklist. Select something to give it a value or take it off the blacklist. The `/emc missing` window gets a **Blacklist it** button. Changes are saved to the server config (`Blacklist`, and the new `Allow` list for exceptions to the built-in blacklist).
- Settings: `WatchChangesWorldTime` (turn off to keep the watch's effect local, e.g. on busy servers), `WatchSpeedUp` (default 10) and `WatchSlowDown` (default 3).

### Fixed
- **Rendered fat** and anything else cooked into an item in a cooking pot (linseed oil...) now gets its value from the pot recipe. Before it could be valued backwards from something else it's used in (one world had rendered fat at 2,494 EMC).
- The **altar** had no value and didn't show up in `/emc missing`, because it was blacklisted with the story blocks. It now has 64 EMC.

### Credits
- The Klein Star textures are ProjectE's (MIT licence); see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-10-13

### Added — the rest of ProjectE
- **Klein Stars** Ein, Zwei, Drei, Vier, Sphere and Omega (50,000 to 51,200,000 EMC): portable EMC. Right-click to empty one into your EMC, sneak + right-click to fill it. Rings and gadgets draw from stars you carry once your own EMC runs out, combining four stars into the next size keeps their EMC, and sneak + right-clicking a collector or relay with a star charges it.
- **Covalence Dust** (low, medium, high) and the **Iron Band**, used in the recipes below.
- **Rings, stones and amulets**: they work from anywhere in your hotbar or backpack (Vintage Story has no ring slots); right-click switches one on or off.
  - Black Hole Band: pulls loose items to you.
  - Swiftwolf's Rending Gale: run 40% faster, no fall damage.
  - Harvest Goddess Band: crops around you grow faster.
  - Ignition Ring: sets nearby hostile creatures on fire; fire can't hurt you.
  - Zero Ring: freezes water around you.
  - Ring of Arcana: all four of the above, picked with the tool-mode key.
  - Body Stone, Soul Stone and Life Stone: keep you fed and/or heal you using EMC.
  - Repair Talisman: slowly repairs everything you carry and wear.
  - Gem of Eternal Density: turns cheap junk you carry into iron, gold, diamond, dark or red matter.
  - Evertide Amulet and Volcanite Amulet: place water or lava.
  - Watch of Flowing Time: crops in a wide area grow much faster.
- **Gadgets**: Destruction Catalyst (3×3 tunnels), Hyperkinetic Lens and Catalytic Lens (explosions at range), Mercurial Eye (turn blocks into a chosen block), Archangel's Smite (strike a creature up to 48 blocks away), Tome of Knowledge (learn everything), Divining Rods (EMC in the ground below you).
- **Dark Matter Pedestal**: set a ring, stone, amulet or talisman on it and it works on the area around the pedestal for free: grows crops, burns or strikes hostile creatures, freezes water, pulls loose items into a container under it, heals and feeds nearby players, or repairs their gear.
- **Armour**: Dark Matter, Red Matter and Gem helmets, chestplates and leggings, on the game's plate armour models. They never wear out; a full gem set makes you immune to fall and fire damage.
- **Tools**: Dark and Red Matter Shears, the Red Matter Katar (sword, axe and shears) and the Red Matter Morning Star (pickaxe, shovel and sledgehammer).
- **Blocks**:
  - Alchemical Chest (104 slots) and Alchemical Bags (12 colours, 32-slot backpack bags).
  - Alchemical Coal, Mobius Fuel and Aeternalis Fuel blocks.
  - Dark and Red Matter Furnaces: smelt, fire and cook anything (ore straight to ingots), on fuel or on EMC from collectors.
  - Anti-Matter Relays MK1–MK3: store and boost collector EMC and pass it on.
  - Nova Catalyst and Nova Cataclysm explosives.
  - Interdiction Torch: keeps hostile creatures away.
- `/emc help` lists every command with a short description.
- In the `/emc missing` window, admins can click a name, type a value and press **Set value**. The value is saved like `/emc set` and the list refreshes.
- Settings: `HostileCreatures` (what the ignition ring, smite and interdiction torch affect) and `TrinketCostMultiplier`.

### Changed
- Items caught in a recipe loop that never settles now keep the first value they got instead of losing it.

### Not included
- The Mind Stone: Vintage Story has no experience points.
- Separate boots: Vintage Story armour has head, body and legs slots, so the leggings cover the feet.
- ProjectE's furnaces are adapted to how smelting works in Vintage Story, which has no furnaces.

## 1.3.1 — 2026-10-13

### Fixed
- `/emc missing` no longer crashes the game with a null pointer exception. The list now shows item icons inline (the same way the handbook does) and pages through long lists 40 entries at a time.
- The scrollbar in that window was drawn in the wrong place.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-10-13

### Added
- **Chat summary**: when you join (and after `/emc recalc`, `set` or `clear`) chat shows e.g. `Vintage-E version 1.3.0: calculated 13983 EMC values, 0 missing.` Turn it off with `AnnounceInChat`.
- **`/emc missing` window**: a scrollable list of everything without an EMC value, with item icons, a search bar, a mod filter, a blocks/items filter and a button that copies the codes ready to paste into `BaseValues`. Clicking an icon opens its handbook page.
- **3D matter tools**: the dark and red matter pickaxe, shovel, axe, sword and hoe now use the game's own 3D tool models with matter textures, so they're held, swung and displayed like vanilla metal tools (pickaxe swing, axe chop, shovel dig, falx sword swing) and fit on tool racks and the ground.
- **Sledgehammers**: the dark and red matter hammers are now sledgehammers with their own model. They smash stone, ore and other hard blocks 3×3 from the start (the red one can switch to 5×5 with the tool-mode key; sneak for a single block).
- **Trader prices**: things no recipe makes (clothes, loot armour, decorations…) are valued from what traders buy and sell them for. What a rusty gear is worth is measured each start from traded items that already have a value (about 57 EMC in vanilla), and the rusty gear itself is set to that.
- **Working backwards from crafting**: if a recipe's result has a value and only one ingredient doesn't (loot parts, gold jewellery…), that ingredient gets what's left over.
- **Value file sections**: `defaultValues` (only used when nothing else can value an item), `litreValues` (liquids per litre), `traderCurrency` and `allow` (exceptions to the blacklist).
- `/emc dump` (and the new `DumpValuesOnStart` setting) writes what every value was worked out from, e.g. `grid: 1 game:log-placed-oak-ud -> 12 game:plank-oak`.
- Soil and farmland are worth more the more fertile they are (very low 1 → terra preta 16).
- Butterflies (caught and dead) have values.
- Tooltips show liquids per litre, and buckets, bags and pots show what their contents are worth.
- New settings: `AnnounceInChat`, `InferValuesFromCrafting`, `UseTraderPrices`, `DumpValuesOnStart`.
- A "Test on a real server" GitHub workflow that compiles the mod against the real game and checks every value on a fresh 1.22.7 world.

### Changed
- Water is set per litre: 1 L of water = 1 EMC (ale and other drinks follow from their recipes: spelt ale is 45 EMC per litre).
- Coverage on vanilla 1.22.7 is now **100%** of the 8,096 blocks and items in the creative inventory (was about 80%).

### Fixed
- The mod's creative inventory tab had no name.
- Tin bronze, bismuth bronze and black bronze, and everything smithed from them, were worth almost nothing. Smithing now costs the whole ingots you have to put on the anvil, and value loops that creep down are detected and stopped.
- Rusty gears were worth far more than they buy, so selling things for gears and burning the gears made EMC from nothing.
- A few items (bear hide helmets) could lose their value on the second pass of the calculation.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-10-13

### Added
- **Drying time bonus**: drying adds 64 EMC per in-game day an item takes to dry. Other transitions (curing, ripening…) can be given a bonus too with `TransitionEmcPerDay`.
- **Casting**: items cast in tool molds cost the metal poured into them (`requiredUnits`, 100 units = 1 ingot); molds that break when filled add their own cost.
- **Processes with several outputs** share their value fairly: squeezing honeycomb (honey + beeswax), ground-storage processing such as sawing (including anything left behind) and the fruit press (juice + pressed mash).
- `relativeValues` rules in value files. Metal bits are worth 1/20 of the matching ingot, even for metals that can't be smelted.

### Changed
- Flax fibers are worth 4× as much (8 → 32).
- Beeswax and honey now get their values from squeezing honeycomb instead of fixed guesses.
- Smelting data is also read from items that work it out in code.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-10-13

### Fixed
- Barrel liquids (brine, diluted solutions, tannin) and everything made from them, such as leather, were hugely overvalued. Barrel outputs now count the portions the game actually gives.
- Crafting recipes that use a bucket or bowl of liquid now cost the liquid, not the container you get back.

### Changed
- Raw hides follow their leather yield: small 16, medium 32, large 48, huge 80.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-13

### Added
- **EMC cache**: values are saved per world and reused on the next start when nothing that affects them has changed (game version, mods, config, value files, recipes, item data). `/emc recalc` always recalculates; `CacheEmcValues: false` turns the cache off.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-13

First version (not published as a GitHub release).

- EMC values worked out automatically at server start from every loaded recipe and process, including other mods'.
- Philosopher's Stone, Transmutation Table and Tablet, alchemical fuels, dark and red matter (and blocks), unbreakable matter tools with area mining, Energy Collectors MK1–3 and Energy Condensers MK1–2.
- Base values, blacklist and philosopher's stone rules in data files any mod can extend; server config and `/emc` commands for admins.
