## ProjectE

Vintage-E is a Vintage Story port of the Minecraft mod [ProjectE](https://github.com/sinkillerj/ProjectE).
These files are ProjectE's own artwork and sounds, used under its MIT licence (below):

- the Klein Star item textures, `assets/vintagee/textures/item/kleinstar-*.png`;
- ProjectE's textures in `assets/vintagee/textures/projecte/` and sounds in `assets/vintagee/sounds/projecte/`,
  used when the server turns on the `ProjectETextures` / `ProjectESounds` settings. They are copied unchanged by
  `tools/import_projecte_assets.py`, except the files in `textures/projecte/derived/`, which that script cuts out of
  ProjectE's condenser, alchemical chest and interdiction torch textures to fit Vintage-E's block models. The sounds
  are renamed after the ProjectE sound events that play them (`peheal.ogg` is `heal.ogg`, and so on).

ProjectE credits the creator of Equivalent Exchange 2, x3n0ph0b3, for allowing the use of EE2's assets, and
MidnightLightning for EE2's GUI textures; some of these textures and sounds go back to EE2.
